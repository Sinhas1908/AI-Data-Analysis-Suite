AI Data Analysis Suite – Reference Guide

1. Project Overview 
This project is an AI-powered **Data Analysis Suite** that supports **file uploads, AI-generated insights, speech-to-text, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).**  

Features Overview**  
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| File Upload| Supports CSV and Excel (XLSX) files |
| AI Insights| Uses OpenAI API to analyze and summarize data |
| Speech-to-Text| Converts voice input into actionable queries |
| EDA Reports| Generates numerical and categorical summaries |
| Text-to-Speech| Reads AI-generated insights aloud |

Sample Data Format (DMart Data Store.xlsx)  
Example dataset included in `/data/` folder:  

| ID | Product | Category | Price | Quantity | Sales |  
|----|---------|----------|--------|----------|-------|  
| 1  | Laptop | Electronics | 45000 | 2 | 90000 |  
| 2  | Shampoo | Grocery | 250 | 5 | 1250 |  

API Usage – OpenAI Integration 
The AI model used for insights is "GPT-4 Turbo", called via OpenAI’s API. The system prompt for analysis is:  

"You are a senior data scientist. Analyze this dataset and provide insights based on user queries." 

How to Use Speech-to-Text 
- Record or upload an audio file (MP3, WAV, OGG).  
- The system will transcribe it using OpenAI Whisper API.  
- The transcribed text will be used as a query for AI analysis.
